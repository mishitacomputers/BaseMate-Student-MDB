    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Q: I forgot my password. How can I recover it?</h3>
    <p>A: You can retrieve it from your registered email address. Every time you reset or change your password, a copy is automatically sent to your email. Note: Password reset is only supported while connected to the internet.</p>

    <h3>Q: I didn&rsquo;t receive the login (OTP) verification code. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>A: Ensure your device is connected to the internet. Check your Spam or Junk folder in your email. If the issue persists, contact your system administrator for assistance.</p>

    <h3>Q: I keep seeing &ldquo;This Application is Blocked.&rdquo; What does this mean and what should I do?</h3>
    <p>A: This message indicates that your account has been restricted and you cannot use it. Please contact the system administrator or developer at 0725 482521 for assistance.</p>

    <h3>Q: &ldquo;Verifying authenticity please wait?&rdquo; This is the message I see every time I log in.</h3>
    <p>A: No need to worry. This message is part of the system&rsquo;s security process to validate your license and account status each time you log in.</p>

    <h3>Q: I used to receive login notifications, but I don&rsquo;t anymore.</h3>
    <p>A: Please ensure that login notifications are enabled in the Settings form. You will receive a notification each time someone attempts to log in to your application, provided the PC is connected to the internet.</p>

    <h3>Q: All student learners show &lsquo;Learning is in progress&rsquo;. What could be the issue?</h3>
    <p>A: This is likely related to your computer's date and time settings. The application depends entirely on your system's date and time to provide accurate information. Ensure your PC has the correct and updated date/time settings.</p>

    <h3>Q: Why do some forms take longer to load?</h3>
    <p>A: This may occur when certain automated features are enabled. During form initialization, the system checks for an active internet connection. If a connection is detected but no data is transmitted, loading may be temporarily delayed while the system verifies connectivity.</p>

    <h3>Q: &lsquo;All charts and data successfully loaded&rsquo;. This is the message I see, yet some charts and graphs don&rsquo;t appear on the form.</h3>
    <p>A: This may be due to loading delays&mdash;queries can occasionally take longer than expected to complete. Simply close and reopen the form to refresh the charts.</p>

    <h3>Q: How do I back up my data?</h3>
    <p>A: There are two backup options: Simply go to the Settings form, and pick the action button to take the desired backup (Full, Passports, or Data tables). Or automate the process every 14 days by checking &ldquo;auto data backup&rdquo;.</p>

    <h3>Q: Why does the backup process fail?</h3>
    <p>A: Ensure your PC has more than one disk partition. The system does not store backups on C:\\ for safety reasons. Tip: Plug in a removable drive or ensure D:\\ is available before running backups.</p>

    <h3>Q: I see a &ldquo;No encryption tool found&rdquo; error during backup. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>A: Make sure that a file compression tool like 7-Zip is installed on your PC. The system uses it to zip and encrypt backup files.</p>

    <h3>Q: How can I restore a previous backup?</h3>
    <p>A: Open the Settings form and select the Restore option for the data type you wish to recover (e.g., tables, passports, all data). The system will automatically locate your backup folder and begin the restoration process.</p>

    <h3>Q: How do I verify legitimacy of a payment receipt?</h3>
    <p>A: Go to the Settings form, locate the Payment Verification section, enter the payment reference number, and click Verify. The system will process the request and display the result.</p>

    <h3>Q: Can the system work without internet access?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes. Core functions like data entry, reporting, backup, and restore work offline. However, features such as email verification, password reset, and system alerts require an internet connection.</p>

    <h3>Q: Can I share this application with others over a network?</h3>
    <p>A: No. This system is designed as a standalone application to minimize dependency on external service providers (e.g., paid servers). It&rsquo;s optimized for low-cost operation while maintaining full data management capabilities.</p>

    <h3>Q: The barcode doesn&rsquo;t display properly; I only see plain text. Why?</h3>
    <p>A: This happens when the "3 of 9 Barcode" font is not installed on your PC. To fix it, download and install the 3 of 9 Barcode font to enable correct barcode display.</p>
